# Robikz's Input Test

Version: @robikzinputtest_VERSION_FULL@

This desktop application runs on SDL3 and lets you move 2D shapes across
the screen using a keyboard or gamepad. Press specific keys or buttons
to make the shapes flash. Each connected input device controls its own
shape, and devices can be plugged in or removed at any time.

Use this app to measure your input device's reaction time against your
display and identify any input lag.

## Usage

The application displays basic usage info upon launch on the help overlay.

**Measuring Input Lag:**

The app, by itself, is merely reacting to your input by moving or flashing
shapes on screen. To measure actual response time, record your input
device and screen simultaneously with a camera, then count frames
between input activation and visual response.

For quick testing: if lag is noticeable during normal use, it's probably significant.
